Commons Command Runner  Repository
-----------------------------------
This is the command runner repository. Contains the commons-command-runner project and belongs to the commons area of pixelsimple.
This module offes two modes of running a command - 1) Blocking (synchronous) mode and 2) Aynchronous (non-blocking) mode. 

The general rule of thumb is - for short/faster commands, blocking mode can be used, for all long/time consuming commands it is mandatory to use the async mode.
